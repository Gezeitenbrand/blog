# digital clutter and our 168 open tabs

Ok, we made it to Jumanji, Part 2, Level 1. By the time thet I write this, it's still early january 2021 (and this is the first time I wrote 2021 ðŸ™Œ) and I promised to write a series about how to digitally declutter your life and work. This is the second part, if you need to catch up on WHY we keep digital stuff and why it is so difficult (but also most rewarding) to let digital things go, you can read the first part here: https://m365princess.com/digital-clutter-is-evil/

This part is about the tabs in your browser. A lot of our work these days takes place on websites, which means that we live in our browsers and open tabs over tabs to research, procrastinate, get work done, distract ourselves, get information, log into different platforms, search for stuff we searched already 96 times before and so on. This results in *SOME* open tabs. 

## Ok, but what does it matter? 

Why should we care if we have 4 or 40 tabs open? Because whatever is open, unresolved, undecided, pending or active, keeps our minds busy. It increases our mental load and sets us under stress, even if we are not aware of it. If we deal with overload for a longer period of time, we perceive overwhelmment as our normality, which basically means that we drive with handbrake on.

Don't we all 
1. rely on all these open tabs?
2. buy decent machines with tremendous amount of RAM so that they don't overheat?
3. love those posts about mental health and letting go and digital detox? 

Oh right, the latter was just about me :-) Let's have a look into this working habit of having A LOT of tabs open. I think, there are some categories and it would help us to first see, what they are in order to determine, if we really need them, if they harm us or if there is simply a better solution to achieve the same goal. In my day-to-day life as a consultant, I never focus on tools, but on usecases. Let's try this approach here as well:

### tabs we have open while blogging/research

When I researched for and wrote this blogpost, I had these tabs open: 

1. my website m365princess.com, to be able to easily refer to older blogposts in this blog post
2. GitHub, as I write my posts in GitHub these days
3. twitter (to be able to make a poll and search what others already said about 'too many tabs open' )
4. one other tab to do research, like searching for the right image or a quote or googling a fact I can't remember anymore. 

ðŸ’¡ It turns out, that I always use this set of tabs, when I write a blogpost. 

### tabs we have open to learn

Well, learning of course is a good thing. When I learn, I open 

1. the content site (YouTube, MSLearn, Pluralsight, etc. )
2. a website to try out what I learn (Power Platform, Graph Explorer, Azure Portal)
3. twitter to quickly ask questions or express my ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ moments
4. one other tab to research, like googling when I don't know a certain thing that seems to be mandatory to understand the turorial I am following

### tabs we have open because we stumbled upon them and *might* need them later 

Well, we are now entering the *just in case* phase. While we were browsing, researching, looking for inspiration, we found a site, that MIGHT be helpful- later. We can't take advantage of it right now (because we really need to focus on that other thing we need to eventually get done, but perhaps, in the future, we will get back to that site). We keep it, just in case. Do we recognize, that this is the same thing than keeping other digital stuff? Do we realize, that even keeping this tab open will keep at least a part of your mind busy? These open tabs distract us similar to people interrupting our focus work. Does this sound familiar to you? 

![WHAT was I doing?!](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/focus.png "Distractions, everywhere")


ðŸ’¡ I get it, we want to *keep* this URL, but we do not necessarily have this tab open. 

## But what would be a better solution?

Before we can just throw tech solutions on people problems, let's investigate, what happens: 

1. Event: On top of the pyramid, there is the event, that is visible to us and attentive others. 
In our case: *We deal with a tremendous mental load and are easily distracted* 


2. Pattern and trends: underneath the visble event, we could look into the patterns and trends, that lead to these event. Here that would be: *the more different workloads I need to manage, the more overwhelmed I am*

3. System, that supports these patterns: Let's nnow have a look into the system: *We need to react quickly on whatever happens and this reactive working mode puts us in a kind of emergency/attention position which also causes stress and leads to a more ineffective work style* 

4. What is the common belief, that holds this system in place: If we now dive deeper into our believes we will come to the conclusion that although we are praying that "always on" is not a solution, that mental health is important, that it is crucial to set boundaries and that you should have your focus work time to actually get stuff done, we merely don"t act like that. We reply on mails and messages almost immediately, we have all websites constantly open to quickly jump to other tasks and put great pressure on us with that. But: Busy ain't productive!



I do have these tabs open, because I quickly jump from task to task and I wear a lot of different hats
3. First of all: Be aware of the factm that open tabs in which you don"t currently work in, is rather information hoarding and digital clutter than anything else. As a consultant, business owner, active MVP and leader of different initiatives, I wear a lots of different hats



Well, there is an easy to follow step by step approach: 
ideas: 
### tabs we have open while 
- tabs we work in right now
- tabs we plan to work on in the near future
- tabs we want to work on in the mere distant future
- tabs we could perhaps use in the future
- tabe we could perhaps use to help others in the future

*Nothing says "I fixed a bug" like closing 35 tabs.*

*me: App works! RocketRocketRocket*

*also me: closes 63 browser tabs.*
