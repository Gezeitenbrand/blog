# digital clutter is evil

Apart from dresses and shoes, I don't like to own a lot of stuff, I prefer to have only things, that really relate to who I am as a person and I can easily detach emotionally and get rid of things. 

Reading and watching *Fight Club*  was one of my eye-openers here and I can never forget the very famous quote: 

*The things you own end up owning you*. 

By no means I am a minimalist, I don't count my things nor do I raise the question, if a pair of socks is 1 or 2 items or if a a complete drumset is 1 or 21 items. I do not find value in those discussions. But I think its worth to investigate the impact of things in my life. And when I do so, I realize, that apart from the things I have and heavily use, there is also clutter; AKA *stuff*. 

## What is *stuff*? 

Stuff is every item, that you keep for the sake of having it. Perhaps it served a purpose when you bought it, found it or when someone gave it to you, but now you don't have any use for it anymore than just owning it. Some examples? 

- the ugly mug that was a present from a college friend - you keep it because it reminds you of that friend. Last contact? 14 years ago. 
- the nice mug that doesn't fit all your other mugs and you stopped drinking coffee - last use of that mug? Well, you first needed to dust it off...
- the books you bought that only serve as a crecibility bookcase for your zoom calls 

this list could be a lot longer, but I will leave it by that as I think you got the idea what I am talking about. 

## negative impact of hoarding

Technically, we know that clutter isn't good for us. Clutter, both analog and digital one, keeeps our space, money, energy, and focus. It draws our attention from the things we want to DO to the things we HAVE. While a bit more of empty space makes up room for new experiences and where we want to grow to, a full space makes change and growth impossible as all spaces are already occupied. Clutter shifts our drive from acting and growing to having and hoarding. And this represents living in the past or in unrealistiv mental images of yourself: 

- You own a lot of sports gear but don't exercise with them regularly? Then you just fell in love with the *idea* of being a sporty person, but actually you aren't sporty. 
- You have  whole collection of musical instruments but never play them? Then it is more your ideal of being a musician that you like to become reality than it represents who you are. 
- Your bookshelf is full of books you never read? Well, still a great scene for your virtual meetings, but other than that: You fill up space in your surroundings to fill the void inside of you. 

As clutter takes also a lot of space, there is then less space for the things that you really love and that truly represent who you are. Why do we give things, that don't relate to our lives so much room? 

## Why do we just keep everything? 

Just in case. In case of what? In case we need it. 

Although most of us grew up in the big luck of not having to experience any deficiency or lack of things they desparately needed, still we were raised with some beliefs, like 'keeping stuff even for unlikely events is a good thing'. We even have dedicated rooms in our houses for 'stuff that we don't use regularly' like attics and basements. Storage room seems to be a big advantage, even bigger than having room for yourself. All this represents your past, which you still want to hold in your hands. I am not talking about precious memories like family photos or practical things you need and use a few times a year (like a waffle maker or a drill). I am talking about the stuff we keep because something in us isn't ready to let it go: We keep stuff: 

- for ourselves (in case I ever fit again into that jeans from 1992) --> represents an unrealistic mental image of yourself and shows that you didn't let go whats already past
- for others (these baby clothes will someday be for a kid in my extended family) --> projection
- when we can't admit that we failed in doing something (in case I restart to play chess which I lastly did 1992 (you know, when that jeans fit))
- to remind ourselves that we didn't always suck but also achieved some cool things (keeping that trophy of the 3rd place at the Junior District Championships)
- because we fear deficiency
- to impress others  (bookshelf/zoom calls) 
- to impress ourselves (mostly related to things we would like to do but actually don't execute)

And yet again, a *Fight Club* quote comes to my mind: *We buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like.*

Probably, you will say: But I don't care about the stuff in the basement, about the stuff I keep for others or about the 691 little things that are in drawers (your cable box? your lonely socks? your old phones?). Then I need to tell you, that 

1. you just learned to ignore stuff, but it still impacts you whether you like to admit this or not
2. whatever you ignore will somewhen return and hit you badly, so it's better if you care. 

## the perverted approach

Our idea is not anymore 'having something in order to do something with it', but 'having something until it bothers me so much that I need to get rid of it'. And we do a lot to not get bothered. We buy new shelfs, new drawers. And then we buy decoration because the new shelf looks so empty. And then we buy another shelf, because all the decoration doesnt fit anymore. And then we move into a bigger house. And we need a bigger basement, because of the stuff we need to outsource, and then we rent a storage room outside of the city... Or we build a carport, so that more stuff fits into the garage after the car moved out of it. Even if you didn't need to buy new stuff to give other stuff a place to be, you will see that stuff seeks your time and attention. Every item needs a place to belong to (or you will be busy putting it from left to right and from right to left again) and it needs to be cleaned and maintained. Having a thing is always a commitment. Before I buy a thing, I do not only think if I can afford this, but how much time it will take me to act according the purpose of it. Buying a book is easy, but how likely will I spend 10-20 hours in the next 3 months on reading it? 

## digital stuff

This brings me to some thoughts about stuff, that doesn't take a lot of physical space, but still increases our mental load. Enrolling a new course to learn something? *Wow, it's free. CLICK HERE. Yes, subscribe for the newsletter.* How likely is it, that I will not only not read this newsletter, but also defer unsubscribing from it? How often will this draw my attention while it's already hard for me to stay focused? How likely will I not just watch the intro of the new course? And how likely will this book, course, podcast just end up in that *pile of guilt*? There are more examples:


- the app you never use
- the acounts that announce their blog posts on twitter you never find time to read
- your 42 open tabs (but!)
- 16 variations of the same photo
- your email trashbin
- chats with your ex
- abandoned side projects

and so on. I am on my phone a lot. Some would say, that I have a deep relationship with it. If you are a little like me, you will merely, not use it as a phone, but as a remote control for your whole life (and with a remote control for the remote control aka Apple Watch. 

We easily have 100+ apps installed and because we need to record 4k video, have thousands of songs on our phones and hoard all kinds of other data, we need phones with an insane storage capacity. And now that we have that capacity, we hoard even more. And then we pay cloud services to outsource apps and files... Do you recognize a pattern? We repeat the behavior we show in our analog lives in our digital lives. So would it help if we asked ourselves why we keep the digital stuff? Why do we not delete chats of people we are not in contact with anymore? Why do we still keep that domain we once registered but then never worked on it again? Same reasons as you keep physical stuff: JUST. IN. CASE. 
Not, that this case will EVER occur, though. 

What happens actually, once we dig a little bit deeper into what triggers us to keep and hoard? We will gain clarity about what drives us- and what holds us (back). Because, if we hold everything, our hands aren't free, we can't *hand-le* anything anymore, literally. The perfidity of digital clutter is, though, that we can more easily hide it. But once we know, if we want to impress ourselves, still live in the past or want to produce a certain image of ourselves, it's easier to get rid of that in order to be honest and truthful with ourselves. It's relieving to toss stuff that weighed a lot. And once you did, you feel alleviated and calmed.
