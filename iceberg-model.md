# The iceberg model and modern working principles in Microsoft 365

## intro about the challenge: 

* adoption is hard because people don't understand WHY they need to change their working behavior
* to simply explain it would be to increase productivity, is not enough, it doesn't connect nor does it reflect their beliefs
* without a shared vision/common understanding, we will only scratch the surface of what M 365 could do in an organization

## approach to solve the issue:

Before we can change itm we first need to udnerstand it and get the bigger picture of the situation we are facing. A good tool to facilitate deeper thinking is the iceberg model.
