# The iceberg model and modern working principles in Microsoft 365

## intro about the challenge: 

* adoption is hard because people don't understand WHY they need to change their working behavior
* to simply explain it would be to increase productivity, is not enough, it doesn't connect nor does it reflect their beliefs
* without a shared vision/common understanding, we will only scratch the surface of what M 365 could do in an organization

The necessity of understanding the real challenge isn't acutally that new: In the 90's (you remember those crazy times, don't you?) the term VUCA was invented by the US military to describe our modern world and the challenges any organisation (not only the military) was facing. This acronym describes a world, in which change becomes and new constant, so planability and consistency are not the factors to describe current markets and environments for organisations

Volatility: the world is changing faster than ever before BUT bhe world will never change as slowly as it is right now. New challenges, competitors and different unpredictable factors are something we have to deal with. That means, that long term planning and the reliability of this planning won't be sufficient for modern organisations.

Unvertainty: Predictability and calculability of events are rapidly decreasing, forecasts and experiences from the past as a basis for shaping the future are losing their validity and relevance. Just look at how quickly and comprehensively Covid has changed the way we are working right now. Do I have to say more?

Complexity: Living in a complex and connected world with various connections that are difficult to keep track of makes it difficult to clearly define cause and effect. The world is not just complicated, it's complex.

Ambiguity: The aspects described above make it clear that decisions today are no longer made between black and white. One size fits all is rarely a suitable model anymore. More and more often, it is not a question of WHAT, but of HOW, or WHY. This leads to the fact that the demands on organization today are paradoxical, sometimes even contradictory


You might think 'So what? The world is changing and markets are getting more complex, so where is the news?', right? Okay, here's the catch:
We've build organisations around structures and processes that were invented to deal with different requirements. The way we build up and think of organisations are still based on the idea, that markets are predictable, change can be planned and our world works in a consisten way. But it's not and I think we all can agree on that. 

So ultimately, we need a new way of thinking about organisation and the way we work. We need new guidelines and principles, that fit the challenges we're facing right now, that fit this new world.

In other word, this new world comes with a need to transform: 

Profit <-> Purpose
Maximising profit was the main driver for successful businesses for a long time. Yet within a connected world full of information that isn't the only constant that ensures success nowadays. Customers often have enough information to compare different organisations and are able to choose who they're engaging with. That appears to customers and employees to the same extend. Nowadays there are many factors that need to be taken into account for a successful business: work ethics, social responsibility, the ecological factor, and so on. Those things often come, when an organisation has a clear purpose, a WHY. Organisations that know why there are doing something, rather than relying on the how have a far better standing in the markets than others. And you know what the trick is? With purpose come profit, but it doesn't work the other way around. Customer and partner have a pretty good idea who they want to deal with and that's what differs a successful organisation from a unsuccessful.

Hierarchies <-> Networks
In a world where you have a compliacted, yet clear task with multiple people to work on that task, you need someone who has a clear understanding of what there is to do. Someone to keep all the strings together and knows where to go. With that comes a clarity about hierarchie, line of command and power. 
Within a world that is chaning fast and context isn't to be overseen by one (or a couple) person, you run into the problem, that there isn't the right way, that one person can't possibly understand all interdependencies. This person has to rely on others to tackle the current task. Yet a clear line of command and a strict hierarchy is opposed to this. Self-organized teams, collaboration between internal and external staff over many borders require a different understanding of leadership and collaboration. Rather than a clear line of command, networks work much better these days to connect different people and create exchanges that meet requirements

Controlling <-> Empowering
Keep the Hierachy - Network idea in the back of your head and spin the thought further: If you can connect with different people, regardless their physical position, neither their standing within a hierarchy, you need them to be able to do something. Within strict organisation with constricting processes build in communications and the IT departments, people have no choice to make an impact. When your at the wrong position in the hierarchy, you'll never contribute. But what if the earthshaking idea is in the head of somebody who can't contribute? Well....
In this modern, ever changing world the person at the top is necessarily the one with the best idea. Often it's quite the opposite: How often have the people on the front line, interacting with customers and challenges know exactly how to solve those needs (I guess you know the answer: VERY often)?

Planning <-> Experimentation

Privacy  <-> Transparency


digitalization need to be the accelerator on that, but can never be the main driver. 

## approach to solve the issue:

Before we can change it, we first need to understand it and get the bigger picture of the situation we are facing. A good tool to facilitate deeper thinking is the iceberg model. 

### whats is the iceberg model

![iceberg model of visible events and unvisble patterns, systems and mental models](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/iceberg.jpg "The iceberg model - a tool to get the bigger picture")

* Events:

Very visbibly, we will find events. An event is the answer to the question *What is happening right now?*
On this level, people only *react* on what just happened and then stop to think about it. 

* Patterns:

Already underneath the surface, we will find patterns: *What has been happening over time? What are the trends?* 
On this level, people think about what led to the visible event and try to connect the dots.
 
* Structures:

Digging one level deeper, we will see which system supports and influences these patterns: *What's influencing these patterns?
Where are the connections between patterns?* 
On this level, people think about what influences these patterns and try to understand the *Why*. 

* Mental models:

Finally, we will investigate, *what values, beliefs or assumptions shape the system and keep it in place?* People now dig into which thinking generated the structures that are in place. 

Let's have a look on how this works in the "old world" 

short intro old world

### iceberg of the old world

* level 1: events - what just happened: 

People can't focus, experience both a lack of efficiency AND effectiveness, waste their times with tasks they shouldn't do at all and are rather busy than productive

* level 2: patterns - what was happening over time? 

People abuse tools, work around disfunctional and organizational structures. They are not familiar with the art of collaboration
information hiding
task switching
unknown art of collaboration

* level 3: structure- what is influencing these patterns? 

  * information silos
  * tools that support working next to each other instead of collaboration
  * lethargy to change / "we've always done it like this before"
  * simple or complicated problems to solve
  * hierarchy

* level 4

   * knowledge is power mentality
   * ego system>eco system
   * command and control
