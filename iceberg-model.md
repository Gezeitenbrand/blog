# The iceberg model and modern working principles in Microsoft 365

## intro about the challenge: 

* adoption is hard because people don't understand WHY they need to change their working behavior
* to simply explain it would be to increase productivity, is not enough, it doesn't connect nor does it reflect their beliefs
* without a shared vision/common understanding, we will only scratch the surface of what M 365 could do in an organization

## approach to solve the issue:

Before we can change itm we first need to udnerstand it and get the bigger picture of the situation we are facing. A good tool to facilitate deeper thinking is the iceberg model. 

### whats is the iceberg model

![iceberg model of visible events and unvisble patterns, systems and mental models](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/iceberg.jpg "The iceberg model - a tool to get the bigger picture")

Events
Very visbibly, we will find events. An event is the answer to the question *What is happening right now?*
On this level, people only *react* on what just happened and then stop to think about it. 

Patterns:
Already underneath the surface, we will find patterns: *What has been happening over time? What are the trends?* 
On this level, people think about what led to the visible event and try to connect the dots.
 
Structures:
Digging one level deeper, we will see which system supports and influences these patterns: *What's influencing these patterns?
Where are the connections between patterns?* 
On this level, people think about what influences these patterns and try to understand the *Why*. 

Mental models:
Finally, we will investigate, *what values, beliefs or assumptions shape the system and keep it in place?* People now dig into which thinking generated the structures that are in place. 

Let's have a look on how this works in the "old world" 

short intro old world

### iceberg of the old world

* level 1

abusement of tools
information hiding
cover my ass

* level 2
no specialized tools in place


* level 3
knowledge is power
simple or complicated problems to solve 

* level 4
ego system>eco system
career is about winning, and destroying others
